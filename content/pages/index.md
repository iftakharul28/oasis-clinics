      Health and wellness are not just trending topics, but central to 
      happiness and welfare. We believe that patient education is one of the 
      most important aspects of healthcare. It is our duty to not only care 
      for our patients but also educate them to prevent diseases from 
      unfolding. With so many misleading buzz-type articles frequently 
      appearing on social media and in mainstream press we simplify what lies 
      behind the scenes from our most trusted sources.
